Just writing my ideas down somewhere for later use.

# 2 player support
########################
2 player support could be achieved by having the 2nd player play as luigi.  
I have the sprites for that, so it wont be a problem.  The second player's input can be found 
with PlayerIndex.Two.  Probably will be done for Xbox only.  Not sure if I want to have
both players playing at the same time, or individually.  Could add extra modes for like "vs" to see who can get the most points per level
and keep track of wins?

# World Loading
#########################
Create and interface as a base class for all worlds.  Have each world know about its own
bounding boxes, currently background, etc.  Have different arrays for specific bounding boxes (tubes vs floor)
